      <p>
        <span
          >Nondisclosure agreements (also called NDAs or confidentiality
          agreements) have become increasingly important for businesses of all
          sizes, serving as the first line of defense in protecting inventions,
          trade secrets, and hard work. These agreements are used when at least
          one person is sharing confidential information with someone else, and
          protect the immediate and future privacy of that disclosed
          information. Once signed, a nondisclosure agreement allows for open
          dialogue between parties, creating an environment in which information
          can be discussed freely and the true objectives of the meeting or
          relationship can be achieved (for example, a company may be created or
          a strategic partnership may be established).</span
        >
      </p>
      <p><span></span></p>
      <p>
        <span
          >There are two key types of nondisclosure agreements: unilateral and
          mutual. Mutual nondisclosure agreements (like the agreement in this
          document) should be used when both parties will be sharing
          confidential information, as when the parties are considering the
          creation of a partnership, joint venture, or merger. Unilateral
          nondisclosure agreements should be used when only one side will be
          sharing confidential information, as when one party is seeking funding
          for or investment in a company.</span
